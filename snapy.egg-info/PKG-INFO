Description: Pysnap Improved
        ===============
        
        [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
        
        A fork of pysnap by [martinp](https://github.com/martinp/pysnap) updated to
        use the new Snapchat API. 
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Pysnap is a standard Python package (setuptools) which can be installed by
        running:
        
            python setup.py install
        
        If you prefer not to install it globally, you can install it inside a
        [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/).
        
        Example API usage
        -----------------
        
        ```python
        
        from pprint import pprint
        from pysnap import Snapchat
        
        s = Snapchat()
        s.login('username', 'password', 'gmail', 'gpasswd')
        snaps = s.get_snaps()
        
        pprint(snaps)
        ```
        
        Basic clients
        -------------
        
        There are two basic clients included in the package, `get_stories.py` for
        downloading stories and `get_snaps.py` for downloading snaps.
        
            $ get_snaps.py -h
            Basic Snapchat client
        
            Usage:
              get_snaps.py [-q] -u <username> [-p <password>]  --gmail=<gmail>
                            --gpasswd=<gpasswd> <path>
        
            Options:
              -h --help                 Show usage
              -q --quiet                Suppress output
              -u --username=<username>  Username
